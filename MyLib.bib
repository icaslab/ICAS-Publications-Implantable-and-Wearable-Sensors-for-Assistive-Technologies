	abstract = {We propose a novel system based on the Floating Mass Transducer ({FMT}) to be used as the active component of a fully implantable, Vibrant Soundbridge-like middle ear implant. The new system replaces the external microphone used in the currently available design with an implantable piezoelectric sensor that is inserted into the incudostapedial joint and picks up the vibrations transmitted to the long process of the incus. The {FMT} is coupled to the round window of the cochlea. We characterize the system by measuring the gain in intracochlear sound pressure using laser Doppler vibrometry at a surgically installed “third window” into the cochlea of six temporal bones. Closed-loop feedback oscillations limit the system's available output. We show that using an adaptive control algorithm, a mean functional gain of up to 40 {dB} is achieved, which is similar to Soundbridge functional gain. The concept matches the {FMT}'s one-point ﬁxation philosophy and offers several advantages over other designs, namely an easy and time-efﬁcient surgery, reversibility of implantation, and natural hearing for the prospective patient. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed system consists of an earpiece, a smartphone and an application that performs real-time speech enhancement. The speaker's voice, which is picked up by the microphone of the earpiece that is worn on the ear, is transmitted to the smartphone via wireless technology. After the speech intelligibility is improved in real time by the deep learning speech enhancement application, it is returned to the earpiece and generates sound. Deep learning speech enhancement algorithms can be used without performing burdensome calculations on the processors in the hearing aid. The results showed that the average usage of the central processing unit in the smartphone was approximately 26\%, and the signal-to-noise ratios improve by at least 20\%. The presented objective and subjective results show that the proposed method achieves comparatively more noise suppression without distorting the audio.},

The study aims to convert three-dimensional (3-D) spatial information into sound information using 6-axis and ultrasonic sensors, and to draw a 3-D depiction of the space ahead for the user. Fourteen participants were involved in testing, wherein 4 were visually impaired. Moreover, the male to female ratio was 7:3, with the average age of participants at 28.8 years. An initial sound recognition experiment was designed to assess the device's accuracy through participant use. Recognition rates were 70\% for normal participants and 88\% for the blind participants. Additional experiments expanded the environmental conditions by requiring participants to discern the distances of 10 objects, positioned at both high and low locations. Two different scenarios were employed: stationary and walking scenarios. The stationary distance measurement participants scored an average of 96 points, while the walking participants averaged 81 points. Under the given conditions, this study found that its assistive device for the visually impaired can draw a 3-D space with 88.5\% accuracy. This probability promises a basic level of utility that can assist those with visual impairment in controlled environments, such as hospitals and homes.},

	abstract = {Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic diseases. For people with hearing loss, communicating with other people, particularly in an environment with considerable background noise, is difficult. Recently, several hearing aids have been developed to improve speech comprehension in a noisy environment. The use of an adaptive beamformer is one of the alternative methods for improving speech intelligibility. However, the adaptive beamformer requires the location of the desired speaker to estimate the time differences of arrival ({TDOAs}) of speech sources to numerous spatially separated sensors in acoustics. In general, the technique of steered response power source localization was used to estimate the {TDOA}; however, this technique was easily affected by environmental reverberation. To overcome the aforementioned concern, a novel hearing aid is proposed in this paper. By using an image processing technology, the location of the desired speaker could be manually selected to provide precise information on the {TDOA}. Moreover, adaptive signal enhancements were implemented in a field-programmable gate array to enhance the speech of interest in real time. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system could improve speech intelligibility in various noisy environments. Therefore, the proposed system may be employed to improve the daily lives of people with hearing the loss in the future.},

The {FF}-{WIOS}2 is wirelessly powered and controlled through a 3-coil inductive link at 60 {MHz}. The {FF}-{WIOS}2 receives stimulation parameters via on-off keying ({OOK}) while sending its rectified voltage information to an external headstage for closed-loop power control ({CLPC}) via load-shift-keying ({LSK}). The {FF}-{WIOS}2 system-on-chip ({SoC}), fabricated in a 0.35-µm standard {CMOS} process, employs switched-capacitor-based stimulation ({SCS}) architecture to provide large instantaneous current needed for surpassing the optical stimulation threshold. The {SCS} charger charges an off-chip capacitor up to 5 V at 37\% efficiency. At the onset of stimulation, the capacitor delivers charge with peak current in 1.7–12 {mA} range to a micro-{LED} (µ{LED}) array for optical stimulation or 100–700 μA range to a micro-electrode array ({MEA}) for biphasic electrical stimulation. Active and passive charge balancing circuits are activated in electrical stimulation mode to ensure stimulation safety. In vivo experiments conducted on three anesthetized rats verified the efficacy of the two stimulation mechanisms. The proposed {FF}-{WIOS}2 is potentially a reconfigurable tool for performing untethered neuromodulation.},

Nevertheless, the evolution of such interfaces is currently hampered by the unavailability of embedded platforms capable of delivering the required computational power at high energy efficiency and allowing for a small and unobtrusive form factor. To fill this gap, we developed {BioWolf}, a highly wearable (40 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm) {BCI} platform based on Mr. Wolf, a parallel ultra low power system-on-chip featuring nine {RISC}-V cores with {DSP}-oriented instruction set extensions. {BioWolf} also integrates a commercial 8-channel medical-grade analog-to-digital converter, and an {ARM}-Cortex M4 microcontroller unit ({MCU}) with bluetooth low-energy connectivity. To demonstrate the capabilities of the system, we implemented and tested a {BCI} featuring canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}) of steady-state visual evoked potentials. The system achieves an average information transfer rate of 1.46 b/s (aligned with the state-of-the-art of bench-top systems). Thanks to the reduced power envelope of the digital computational platform, which consumes less than the analog front-end, the total power budget is just 6.31 {mW}, providing up to 38 h operation (65 {mAh} battery). To our knowledge, our design is the first to explore the significant energy boost of a parallel {MCU} with respect to single-core {MCUs} for {CCA}-based {BCI}.},

Methods: The development of a flexible multi-modal multi-channel probe for the simultaneous measurement of the {NIRS}, {ECoG}, and surficial temperature obtained from the cerebral cortex was carried out. Photoelectric bare chips for {NIRS} channels, miniature temperature-coefficient thermistors for measuring localized temperature variation, and 3-mm-diameter platinum plates for {ECoG} recording were assembled on a polyimide-based flexible printed circuit to create six channels for each modality. A conformal coating of Parylene-C was applied on all the channels except the {ECoG} to make the probe surface biocompatible. Results: As a first-in-human study, the simultaneous measurement capability of the multi-modality probe, with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy, to observe pathological neural activities in subjects during surgery and post-operative monitoring, with no complications two weeks since the implantation, was confirmed. Conclusion: The feasibility of using a single device to assess the dynamic pathological activity from three different aspects was determined for human patients. Significance: The simultaneous and accurate multi-channel recording of electrical, hemodynamic, and thermographic cortical activities in a single device small enough for subdural implantation is likely to have major implications in neurosurgery and neuroscience.},

Today, three major manufacturers provide implantable systems for {DBS}. Although the underlying principle is basically the same for all available systems, the differences in the technical features vary considerably. This article outlines aspects regarding the technical features of {DBS} systems. The differences between voltage and current sources are addressed and their effect on stimulation is shown. To maintain clinical benefit and minimize side effects the stimulation field has to be adapted to the requirements of the patient. Shaping of the stimulation field can be achieved by the electrode design and polarity configuration. Furthermore, the electric signal consisting of stimulation rate, stimulation amplitude and pulse width affect the stimulation field. Interleaving stimulation is an additional concept, which permits improved treatment outcomes. Therefore, the electrode design, the polarity, the electric signal, and the concept of interleaving stimulation are presented. The investigated systems can be also categorized as rechargeable and non-rechargeable, which is briefly discussed. Options for interconnecting different system components from various manufacturers are presented. The present paper summarizes the technical features and their combination possibilities, which can have a major impact on the therapeutic effect.},

Encouraging results have demonstrated partial visual restoration, with improvement in both coarse objective function and performance of everyday tasks. To date, four systems have received marketing approval for use in Europe or the United States, with numerous others undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation, reflecting the established safety profile of these devices for chronic implantation. This progress represents the first notion that the field of visual restorative medicine could offer blind patients a hope of real and measurable benefit. However, there are numerous complex engineering and biophysical obstacles still to be overcome, to reconcile the gap that remains between artificial and natural vision. Current developments in the form of enhanced image processing algorithms and data transfer approaches, combined with emerging nanofabrication and conductive polymerization techniques, herald an exciting and innovative future for retinal prosthetics.

	abstract = {Biomedical signal monitoring systems have rapidly advanced in recent years, propelled by significant advances in electronic and information technologies. Brain-computer interface ({BCI}) is one of the important research branches and has become a hot topic in the study of neural engineering, rehabilitation, and brain science. Traditionally, most {BCI} systems use bulky, wired laboratory-oriented sensing equipments to measure brain activity under well-controlled conditions within a confined space. Using bulky sensing equipments not only is uncomfortable and inconvenient for users, but also impedes their ability to perform routine tasks in daily operational environments. Furthermore, owing to large data volumes, signal processing of {BCI} systems is often performed off-line using high-end personal computers, hindering the applications of {BCI} in real-world environments. To be practical for routine use by unconstrained, freely-moving users, {BCI} systems must be noninvasive, nonintrusive, lightweight and capable of online signal processing. This work reviews recent online {BCI} systems, focusing especially on wearable, wireless and real-time systems.},

	abstract = {As sensors and actuators are normally not (and have not been) treated in academic curricula as a subject in its own right; many students and current professionals often find themselves limited in their knowledge and dealing with topics and issues based on material they may have never encountered. Until now. This book brings sensors, actuators and interfaces out of obscurity and integrates them for multiple disciplines including electrical, mechanical, chemical, and biomedical engineering. Real world cases, worked examples, and problem sets with selected answers provide both fundamental understanding and how industry develops sensor systems. Students and professionals from any of these disciplines will easily learn the foundational concepts and then be able to apply them to cross-discipline requirements. The idea is simple. A sensor system in general is made of three components: 1.Inputs (sensors) 2.Outputs (actuators) 3.Processor (the unit to which the inputs and outputs are connected and performs all, or the most, tasks needed to interface them). Sensors, Actuators, and their Interfaces focuses on the broad area of detection, outlining and simplifying the understanding of theory behind sensing and actuation. It is an invaluable textbook for undergraduate and graduate level courses, as well as a reference for professionals who were never afforded the opportunity to take an introductory course.},

Current methods to assess the quality of sleep are invasive and not suitable for continuous monitoring in real world contexts. We have developed a smart sensing solution for non invasive sleep monitoring specifically conceived for the early identification of pre-clinical sleep disorders and insomnia in the general population. Our prototype, named the Smart-Bed, is a low-cost solution that gathers and processes data on the movement and position of the subject, physiological signals, and environmental parameters. Our tests on the prototype in controlled lab conditions highlighted that the mattress can reliably detect subject's position/motion, heart rate and breathing activity. It performs well compared to polysomnography and correctly classifies four behavioural conditions (no bed occupancy, wakefulness, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep), which are the basis for creating an objective sleep quality index.},

Two types of features are proposed to obtain the relative blood pressure, one based on the strength and the other on the morphology of the bed sensor ballistocardiogram pulses. The relative blood pressure is related to the actual by a scale and an offset factor that can be obtained through calibration. The proposed system is able to extract the relative blood pressure more accurately with a less sophisticated sensor system compared to those from the literature. We tested the system using a dataset collected from 48 subjects right after active exercises. Comparison with the ground truth obtained from the blood pressure cuff validates the promising performance of the proposed system, where the mean correlation between the estimate and the ground truth is near to 90\% for the strength feature and 83\% for the morphology feature.},

Through arranging the sensing fiber between two elastic covering layers with sandwich structure, the mattress was sensitive to the respiration and heartbeat induced micro-pressure. In the processing terminal, the waveforms of vital signs were demodulated by 3 * 3 coupler based differentiate and cross-multiplying method, and then four characteristic indicators including the heart rate, heartbeat amplitude, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude were respectively extracted through feature extraction algorithm, for evaluating the human health condition. Clinical experimental results of eighteen subjects indicate that the mattress system could not only distinguish the activity states of no body, on bed, body movement and off bed, but also contribute to clinical diagnosis of bradycardia, tachycardia, polypnea and apnoea. By adopting Bland-Altman analysis method, good reproducibility and accuracy were confirmed, where the max errors of heart rate and respiration rate are respectively 2 bpm and 1 bpm. Moreover, the responses at different positions of the mattress are identical and the continuous monitoring results in one day are consistent with daily change of vital signs, which proves that the fiber optic mattress has good reliability and stability. Beneficial from high-sensitivity, multiple parameters, long-term continuous monitoring, high comfortability and low cost, the mattress is promising in the early detection and prevention of cardiac and respiratory diseases as a household medical device.},

	doi = {10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2911199},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel unobtrusive multi-modal sensor for monitoring of physiological parameters featuring capacitive electrocardiogram (cECG), reflective photoplethysmogram (rPPG), and magnetic induction monitoring (MI) in a single sensor. The sensor system comprises sensor nodes designed and optimized for integration into a grid-like array of multiple sensors in a bed and a central controller box for data collection and processing. Hence, it is highly versatile in application and suitable for unobtrusive monitoring of vital signs, both in a professional setting and a home-care environment. The presented hardware design takes both inter-modal interference between cECG and MI into account as well as intra-modal interference due to cross talk between two MI sensors in close vicinity. In a lab study, we evaluated a prototype of our new multi-modal sensor with two sensor nodes on four healthy subjects. The subjects were lying on the sensors and exercising with a hand grip in order to increase heart rate and thus evaluate our sensor both during changing physiological parameters as well as a wider range of those. Heart beat intervals and heart rate variability were derived from both cECG and rPPG. Breathing intervals were derived from the MI sensor. For heart beat intervals, we achieved an RMSE of 2.3 ms and a correlation of 0.99 using cECG. Similarly, using rPPG, an RMSE of 18.9 ms with a correlation of 0.99 was achieved. With regard to breathing intervals derived from MI, we achieved an RMSE of 1.12 s and a correlation of 0.90.},

	abstract = {Recent achievements in the field of electronic skin have provided promising technology for prosthetic systems. However, the development of a bionic tactile-perception system that exhibits integrated stimuli sensing and neuron-like information-processing functionalities in a low-pressure regime remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a tactile sensor for smart prosthetics based on giant magneto-impedance (GMI) material embedded with an air gap. The sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 120 newton−1 (or 4.4 kilopascal−1) and a very low detection limit of 10 micronewtons (or 0.3 pascals). The integration of the tactile sensor with an inductance-capacitance (LC) oscillation circuit enabled direct transduction of force stimuli into digital-frequency signals. The frequency increased with the force stimuli, consistent with the relationship between stimuli and human responses. The minimum loading of 50 micronewtons (or 1.25 pascals), which is less than the sensing threshold value of human skin, was also encoded into the frequency, similar to the pulse waveform of humans. The proposed tactile sensor not only showed desirable sensitivity and low detection limit but also exhibited transduction of digital-frequency signals like human stimuli responses. These features of the GMI-based tactile sensor show potential for its applications in smart prosthetics, especially prosthetic limbs that can functionally replace natural limbs.
A skin-inspired tactile sensor achieved transduction of digital-frequency signals by an inductance-capacitance oscillation mechanism.

Inductive sensors are used to monitor limb-to-socket distance in prosthetic sockets, which reflects socket fit. A styrene\&ndash;ethylene\&ndash;ethylene/propylene\&ndash;styrene (SEEPS) polymer was mixed with iron powder at three concentrations (75, 77, 85 wt\%), and thin disk-shaped samples were fabricated (0.50, 0,75, 1.00 mm thickness). For 85 wt\% samples of 0.50 mm thickness, which proved the best combination of high signal strength and low target volume, inductive sensor sensitivity ranged from 3.2E5 counts/mm at 0.00\&ndash;1.00 mm distances to 7.2E4 counts/mm at 4.00\&ndash;5.00 mm distances. The application of compressive stress (up to 425 kPa) introduced an absolute measurement error of less than 3.3 \&mu;m. Tensile elasticity was 282 kPa, which is comparable to that of commercial elastomeric liners. Durability testing in the shoe of an able-bodied participant demonstrated a change in calibration coefficient of less than 3.8\% over two weeks of wear. The ferrous polymer composite may facilitate the development of automatically adjusting sockets that use limb-to-socket distance measurement for feedback control.},

In order to assess the prospective efficacy of the control method, experiments were conducted on six healthy subjects who performed a series of pick-and-place tasks within a virtual environment. The assessments compared the time required to complete the pick-and-place tasks using the proposed coordinated control approach, with the time required using a sequential control approach (i.e., the conventional approach used in commercial devices).

	abstract = {The socket is the most critical part of every lower-limb prosthetic system, since it serves as the interfacial component that connects the residual limb with the artificial system. However, many amputees abandon their socket prostheses due to the high-level of discomfort caused by the poor interaction between the socket and residual limb. In general, socket prosthesis performance is determined by three main factors, namely, residual limb-socket interfacial stress, volume fluctuation of the residual limb, and temperature. This review paper summarizes the various sensing and actuation solutions that have been proposed for improving socket performance and for realizing next-generation socket prostheses. The working principles of different sensors and how they have been tested or used for monitoring the socket interface are discussed. Furthermore, various actuation methods that have been proposed for actively modifying and improving the socket interface are also reviewed. Through the continued development and integration of these sensing and actuation technologies, the long-term vision is to realize smart socket prostheses. Such smart socket systems will not only function as a socket prosthesis but will also be able to sense parameters that cause amputee discomfort and self-adjust to optimize its fit, function, and performance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report presents estimates of surgical and nonsurgical procedures performed in the United States during 1995. Data are presented by characteristics of patients, region of the country, and procedure categories for ambulatory and inpatient procedures separately and combined.
METHODS: Estimates in this report are based on data collected from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) and the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (NSAS). NHDS provides data on hospital inpatient care, and NSAS provides data on ambulatory surgery in hospitals and in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. For NHDS, data were collected for approximately 263,000 discharges from 466 non-Federal short-stay hospitals (92 percent response rate). For NSAS, data were collected for approximately 122,000 ambulatory surgery discharges from 489 hospitals and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (80 percent response rate).
RESULTS: An estimated 69.2 million procedures were performed on 38.7 million discharges from hospitals and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers during 1995: 39.8 million procedures were for inpatients, and 29.4 million were for ambulatory patients. Females had more procedures than males, and the rate of procedures increased with age in ambulatory and inpatient settings. The leading procedures for ambulatory surgery patients and inpatients combined were endoscopy of small intestine, arteriography and angiocardiography, extraction of lens, and endoscopy of large intestine.},

The measurement of distributed pressure and detection of irregular sitting postures is essential for preventing the risk of developing pressure ulcer.

A thin and flexible large area sensor is screen-printed using silver flake and carbon particle inks and comprises 16 sensing elements. For the evaluation of practical usability, the sensor characterization is carried out by conducting stability, repeatability, drift, and bending tests. The performance of the sensor is checked under varying environmental conditions. Sitting posture detection accuracy above 80\% is achieved using a classification algorithm for four different sitting postures. Pressure distribution is monitored at a scanning rate of 10 Hz. A low-power and small form factor of readout electronics enables a compact packaging inside the seat cushion. The presented sensor design targets smart wheelchairs, but it is extendable to much larger areas, for example, to be used in beds.

Mining the hidden information of the postures can reveal their wellness and general health conditions. In this paper, a cushion-based posture recognition system is used to process pressure sensor signals for the detection of user’s posture in the wheelchair. The proposed posture detection method is composed of three main steps: data level classification for posture detection, backward selection of sensor configuration, and recognition results compared with previous literature. Five supervised classification techniques—Decision Tree (J48), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)—are compared in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. Results indicate that the J48 classifier provides the highest accuracy compared to other techniques. The backward selection method was used to determine the best sensor deployment configuration of the wheelchair. Several kinds of pressure sensor deployments are compared and our new method of deployment is shown to better detect postures of the wheelchair users. Performance analysis also took into account the Body Mass Index (BMI), useful for evaluating the robustness of the method across individual physical differences. Results show that our proposed sensor deployment is effective, achieving 99.47\% posture recognition accuracy. Our proposed method is very competitive for posture recognition and robust in comparison with other former research. Accurate posture detection represents a fundamental basic block to develop several applications, including fatigue estimation and activity level assessment.},

The sensing architecture was tested by a female user during pressure relief exercises, to verify its effectiveness on pressure monitoring. The proposed system proves to be a compact and reliable solution for wheelchair pressure ulcer prevention, making it a suitable alternative to existing conventional electronic sensors, with the advantage of being immune to electromagnetic interferences and usable in humid environments. In addition to the pressure, the breathing rate was also monitored. By combining the proposed sensing architecture with a wheelchair user detection software, it is possible to create alerts for the user to know when a new position should be adopted, in order to relieve the pressure in a specific area, thus avoiding one of the biggest problems for such patients, pressure ulcers.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report the development of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) arrays in polymer optical fibers (POFs), specifically cyclic transparent optical polymer (CYTOP) fibers, using a femtosecond (fs) laser. The CYTOP is almost transparent to near-ultraviolet and visible light, thus femtosecond lasers appear to be a very promising technology for the development of gratings in such fibers. Bearing this in mind, we have applied the direct write, plane-by-plane inscription method to obtain `single-peak' FBGs in long arrays. Following this, we examine the performance of a 5-FBG array applied in a smart walker (SW) and characterized for four different functionalities of the proposed healthcare device. The polymer sensors were used to analyze 1) structural health monitoring (SHM) of the SW's mechanical structure; 2) detection of users' movement intention; 3) gait cadence estimation; and 4) detection of floor-induced vibrations for localization and mapping applications. The good results obtained in comparison to commercially available devices show the suitability of the proposed FBG-array on the instrumentation of healthcare devices, where multiple parameters can be measured using the same fiber, which leads to a compact and energy efficient system.},

	abstract = {Smart canes are usually developed to alert visually challenged users of any obstacles beyond the canes' physical lengths. The accuracy of the sensors and their actuators' positions are equally crucial to estimate the locations of the obstacles with respect to the users so as to ensure only correct signals are sent through the associated audio or tactile feedbacks. For implementations with low-cost sensors, however, the users are very likely to get false alerts due to the effects from noise and their erratic readings, and the performance degradation will be more noticeable when the positional fluctuations of the actuators get amplified. In this paper, a multi-sensor obstacle detection system for a smart cane is proposed via a model-based state-feedback control strategy to regulate the detection angle of the sensors and minimize the false alerts to the user. In this approach, the overall system is first restructured into a suitable state-space model, and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based controller is then synthesized to further optimize the actuator's control actions while ensuring its position tracking. We also integrate dynamic feedback compensators into the design to increase the accuracy of the user alerts. The performance of the resulting feedback system was evaluated via a series of real-time experiments, and we showed that the proposed method provides significant improvements over conventional methods in terms of error reductions.},

An off-the-shelf offset cane was instrumented with inertial, force, and ultrasound sensors for noninvasive data collection. Eighteen patients from a neurological out-patient rehabilitation clinic and nine independently mobile controls participated in standard clinical evaluations of mobility using the ICS while under the care of an attending physical therapist. Feasibility of the ICS was gauged through two studies. The first demonstrated the capability of the ICS to reliably collect meaningful usage metrics, and the second provided preliminary support for the discriminability of high and low falls risk from system-reported metrics. Specifically, the cane significantly differentiated patients and controls (p {\textless}; 0.05), and a measure of the variation in rotational velocity was associated with total scores on the Functional Gait Assessment (partial r = 0.61, p {\textless}; 0.01). These findings may ultimately serve to complement and even extend current clinical assessment practices.},

	abstract = {To provide autonomous navigation and orientation to visually impaired people, this article proposes a new electronic assistive device called the NavCane. The device helps people find obstacle-free paths in both indoor and outdoor settings. The NavCane also aids in the recognition of objects in an indoor setting. The advantage of the NavCane device is that it provides priority information about obstacles in the path without causing information overload. The priority information deduced by the system is transmitted to the user using tactile and auditory communication methods. Unlike existing electronic travel assistance systems which are limited to obstacle detection and path finding, the NavCane also helps users by recognizing objects in known indoor settings. The developed prototype is low cost and as a low power embedded device for obstacle detection and obstacle identification, it is an alternative to machine vision systems. It has a radio-frequency identification reader, ultrasonic sensors, a global system for mobile communication module, a global positioning system module, vibration motors, a gyroscope, a wet floor sensor, and a battery. To test the usefulness of the NavCane in mundane commuting, object recognition, and rehabilitation for visually impaired people, we assessed it with the help of 80 visually impaired people from a blind school and a home for elderly people. All the assessments were executed in controlled indoor and outdoor test environments with both a NavCane and a white cane. The experimental results show that the NavCane is an effective device for detecting of obstacles, ascending and descending staircases, navigating wet floors, and object recognition in environments that are known and unknown to the user. In addition, our evaluation results indicate that the NavCane improves the performance of obstacle-free navigation compared to a white cane.},

Force unbalance is measured by load cells attached to the walker legs, while motor incoordination is estimated by synchronizing force measurements with distance data provided by an optical sensor. The measurement system is equipped with a Bluetooth link that enables local supervision on a computer or tablet. Calibration and experimental results are included in the paper.},

The aim of this paper is to describe the main parameters (displacements, stress, volume fluctuations and temperature) affecting the stump-socket interface and reducing the comfort/stability of limb prostheses. In this review, a classification of the different socket types proposed in the literature is reported, together with an analysis of advantages and disadvantages of the different solutions, from multiple viewpoints. The paper then describes the technological solutions available to face an altered distribution of stresses on the residual limb tissues, volume fluctuations affecting the stump overtime and temperature variations affecting the residual tissues within the socket. The open challenges in this research field are highlighted and the possible future routes are discussed, towards the ambitious objective of achieving an advanced socket able to self-adapt in real-time to the complex interplay of factors affecting the stump, during both static and dynamic tasks.},

	abstract = {Objective: We designed and validated a wearable, multimodal sensor brace for knee joint health assessment. Methods: An embedded-, two-microcontroller-based approach is used to sample high-throughput, multi-microphone joint acoustics (46.875 {kHz}) as well as lower-rate electrical bioimpedance ({EBI}) (1/46.17 s), inertial (100 – 250 Hz), and skin temperature (1 Hz) data, and these data are saved onto {microSD} cards. Additionally, a flexible, 3D-printed brace houses the custom circuit boards and sensors to enable wearable sensing. Results: The system achieves 9 hours of continuous joint sound recording, while the {EBI}, inertial, and temperature sensors can sample for 35 hours using 500 {mAh} batteries. Further, for the entirety of these continuous recordings, there were no dropped samples for any of the sensors. Lastly, proof-of-concept measurements were used to show the system’s efficacy for recording joint sounds and swelling data. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first, completely untethered wearable system for multimodal knee health monitoring. Significance: The proposed smart brace may facilitate in-clinic or at-home measurements for joint health assessment.},

However, in some cases, severe motor disabilities may generate symptoms such as tremor and spasma and will thus affect the driving ability of the person. The driving task may then become insecure and exhausting for the wheelchair user. In order to assist these persons in the control of powered wheelchairs, we propose to use haptic control devices that allow to feedback forces to the user's hand. This haptic feedback should allow immediate recognition of the free directions in the near environment and bring in easy and smooth handling of the control device through these free spaces. We carried out experiments on a simulator using haptic control devices on a powered wheelchair fitted with a range measurement sensor for obstacle detection. Results show strong interindividual differences of driving behavior, the force feedback acting in general positively on the control.},

The proposed schemes take hereto the non-holonomic nature and a detailed geometry of the wheelchair into consideration. The methods encode the environment as a set of collision-free circular paths and, making use of a model-free impedance controller, `haptically' guide the user along collision-free paths or away from obstructed paths or paths that simply do not coincide with the motion intended by the user. The haptic feedback plays a central role as it establishes a fast bilateral communication channel between user and wheelchair controller and allows a direct negotiation about wheelchair motion. If found unsatisfactory, suggested trajectories can always be overruled by the user. Relying on inputs from user modeling and intention recognition schemes, the system can reduce forces needed to move along intended directions, thereby avoiding unnecessary fatigue of the user. A commercial powered wheelchair was upgraded and feasability tests were conducted to validate the proposed methods. The potential of the proposed approaches was hereby demonstrated.},

The recent development of microelectromechanical system ({MEMS}) devices and nanoelectromechanical system ({NEMS}) devices is also discussed in some detail. The chapter starts with a discussion on capacitive sensors and then moves on to resistive sensors. Following this, the various magnetic sensors in the form of variable inductance, variable reluctance, eddy current, and Hall effect devices are reviewed. This is followed by three sections that cover piezoelectric transducers, strain gauges, and piezoresistive sensors, respectively. The next subject of discussion is optical sensors, which can exist in both open air path and fiber optic forms. In the case of the latter, both intrinsic and extrinsic fiber optic sensors are discussed and the fundamental difference between the two types is explained. Following this, ultrasonic sensors are considered in both transit time and Doppler shift forms. Then, after a brief look at nuclear sensors, the chapter finishes with a discussion on microsensors ({MEMS} and {NEMS} devices).},
